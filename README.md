I created this Recipe Finder app to solve a simple problem that my mom faces. She doesn't like looking online for recipes. She finds it overwhelming. I made an app to solve that for her. Now she can use this app to find recipes without having to look other places, and there are no ads, so it is easy to actually read the recipe.

## Description

All you need to do is type the name of a dish in the search bar, hit Enter, or press the search button, and if a dish with that name is found on the API, the entire recipe, along with an image of the dish will be displayed on the screen.

### Dependencies

-   I used math.js for the math functions

### Installing

-   To download the program, simply run this prompt on your command line:
    git clone https://github.com/syuyrw/12-Recipe-Finder
